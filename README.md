# First Game Demo

This repository is intended to document my progress in making a game using the Godot Development Kit. This is highly experimental and is subject to drastic changes. 

## The Future

I plan to use key gameplay elements in future games, or possibly adapt this game into a fully-functioning commercial success! This is the reason for such strict licensing. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
